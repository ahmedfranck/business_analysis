# Business Analysis Capstone Project

This repository contains the complete materials for a **Business Analysis Capstone Project**, focused on solving operational inefficiencies in a multi-speciality hospital using **Business Analysis techniques** and **data-driven insights**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The project simulates the role of a Business Analyst at **HealthFirst Care Hospital**, where increasing patient complaints and operational challenges have prompted an initiative to improve:

* Patient experience (reducing wait times)
* Resource allocation efficiency
* Communication between stakeholders

As part of this capstone, you will:

* Gather and analyse stakeholder requirements
* Model current (As-Is) and improved (To-Be) processes
* Analyse hospital data using Excel/BI tools
* Build dashboards to track KPIs
* Develop a risk management plan and mitigation strategies

## 📂 Repository Contents

* **Business analysis capstone.pdf** – High-level project overview
* **combined\_lab\_instructions.pdf** – Step-by-step lab guide (10 labs)
* **appointment\_data.csv** – Appointment schedules and patient logs
* **feedback\_data.csv** – Patient satisfaction surveys and feedback
* **resource\_data.csv** – Resource allocation records
* **README.md** – This file

## 🧑‍💻 Tools & Technologies

* **Business analysis**: Lucidchart, MS Visio
* **Data analysis**: Excel, IBM Cognos Analytics, Looker
* **Project management**: WBS templates, Risk management frameworks

## ✅ Expected Deliverables

By following the labs, you will produce:

* Business Requirements Document (BRD)
* Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)
* Stakeholder analysis & WBS
* As-Is and To-Be workflows
* Data analysis outputs (Excel, pivots, charts)
* Interactive dashboards (Cognos/Looker)
* Risk register and mitigation plan
* Final presentation deck
